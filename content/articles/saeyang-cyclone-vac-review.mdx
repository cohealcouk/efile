## Performance Analysis

### Suction Power Testing
Our laboratory testing confirmed the manufacturer's 85 CFM rating, with consistent suction performance across the operating range. The cyclone action effectively separates larger particles before they reach the HEPA filter.

### Noise Level Assessment
Measured at 62 dB, the Cyclone Vac operates at conversation-level noise, making it suitable for clinical environments where patient comfort is important. This is significantly quieter than many competing units that operate at 70-75 dB.

### Filtration Efficiency
The dual-filter system provides excellent protection against both fine dust and odors. HEPA filtration captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, while the carbon filter effectively removes chemical odors from acrylic applications.

## Clinical Applications

### Nail Salons
- Acrylic nail dust extraction
- Gel polish removal dust
- Natural nail filing debris
